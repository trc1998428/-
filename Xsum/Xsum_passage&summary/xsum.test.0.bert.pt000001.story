the public car park is just off the upper newtownards road , one of the main routes into the city .
thousands of wooden pallets are now piled up where previously there were parked cars .
the bonfire makers are involved in a dispute with the city council over the storing of pallets .
they say the council collected pallets from the area earlier this year , agreed to store them and return them this month but failed to do so .
bonfire builder macauley mckinney , 21 , said : `` we had an agreement with the council that they were going to store the pallets in a safe place , and now because the agreement was broken , they 've let us down . ''
belfast city council is not commenting in detail on the issue , as an investigation has been called into the storing of pallets .
a spokesperson said : `` it was agreed at a meeting of belfast city council 's strategic policy and resources committee on friday that an investigation and full review , led by the chief executive with independent input , would be carried out into the issue of collection and storage of bonfire material , and the future approach of bonfires across the city . ''
the committee 's decision needs to be approved at a full council meeting next week .
traditionally , bonfires are lit in many loyalist areas of northern ireland on the `` eleventh night '' - the eve of the twelfth of july , an annual celebration to mark william of orange 's victory over king james ii at the battle of the boyne in 1690 .
