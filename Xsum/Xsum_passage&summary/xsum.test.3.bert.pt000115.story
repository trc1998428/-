alice gibson-watt , 34 , died in 2012 from a brain injury caused by a cardiac arrest , an inquest jury concluded .
a week earlier , she was restrained by police and ambulance staff in a case of post-partum psychosis , a month after giving birth to her first child .
the coroner ruled the use of restraint was not a factor in the death .
her widower , anthony gibson-watt , thanked the coroner for investigating the circumstances leading to the death of his wife .
`` it will never bring alice back , but it has given us a better understanding of how she came to die and in time may help us to move forward , '' he said .
the inquest heard that she was admitted to a&e at chelsea and westminster hospital following the psychotic episode and then taken to the lakeside mental health unit in west middlesex hospital .
at around 03:00 gmt on 16 november mrs gibson-watt , a jewellery specialist for sotheby 's , had a cardiac arrest .
a nurse checked and found no pulse , the inquest heard .
her heart was recorded as restarted at 03:48 , after emergency paramedics had used a defibrillator .
she was moved to a life support machine at king 's college hospital in london , but died on 20 november after a brain scan pronounced her `` life extinct '' .
doctors giving evidence at the inquest said that if there had been a proper response to the cardiac arrest , the brain injury that ultimately caused her death could have been avoided .
mr gibson-watt had called 999 after his wife started screaming , wailing and crawling around on all fours on 13 november .
he told the inquest at west london coroner 's court that she was suffering delusions that their daughter had died .
he also told the court that he and alice met when she was 18 and he was 21 .
they had married nine years later .
`` our romance was long and wonderful , '' he said afterwards .
`` we were a lucky couple : best friends , soul mates with entwined interests . ''
he added that one day he will tell his four-year-old daughter about her wonderful mother .
`` alice insisted on a drug-free birth to give her daughter the very best start possible .
she was enthralled by motherhood , '' he said .
postpartum psychosis is a serious mental illness that affects around one in 1,000 women after they have a baby .
the main symptoms are hallucinations - hearing and seeing things that are n't there - and delusions - thoughts that are not likely to be true .
experiencing psychosis tends to happen within the first two weeks after giving birth , but it can develop later too .
it can severely alter someone 's thinking , emotions and behaviour .
experts do n't know why it occurs in some women , but fluctuations in hormones and changing sleep patterns are thought to play a role .
women are more likely to develop the illness if another member of their family has had it too .
