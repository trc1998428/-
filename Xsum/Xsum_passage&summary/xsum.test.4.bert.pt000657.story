david jordan , 44 , from cavanalinn in pomeroy , county tyrone , is accused of the bomb attack on the officer in castlederg in may 2008 .
the police officer was driving to start a night shift at a police station when a booby-trap bomb hidden under his car exploded .
he escaped from the vehicle but suffered serious leg wounds .
mr jordan is also charged with causing an explosion and belonging or professing to belong to a proscribed organisation .
on thursday , gavin coyle , 38 , was also charged with attempting to murder the police officer .
mr coyle , formerly of culmore park in omagh , county tyrone , but whose address was given as maghaberry prison , also faced charges of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and membership of the ira .
a detective told friday 's hearing at dungannon magistrates ' court that the two men were involved in a `` joint enterprise '' to try to kill the policeman .
she said that when each charge was put to mr jordan during police interviews , he replied : `` i am totally innocent of this fabricated charge . ''
the detective added that the accused then said : `` this is yet another case of internment by remand . ''
mr jordan had originally been arrested in connection with the bombing in the days after the attack , but was released without charge , the court heard .
the detective said police believe cctv footage captured mr jordan and mr coyle driving two vehicles in the vicinity of the officer 's house prior to the bomb .
a trace of nitroglycerin was also found in the boot of a car later seized by police from mr jordan , the detective added .
she said police were opposing bail as the defendant was connected to republican paramilitary groups and could commit offences if he was bailed , adding that he also posed a flight risk .
but a defence lawyer told the court the evidence linking mr jordan to the attack was `` non-existent '' .
he rejected a claim that new evidence had emerged since his client 's original arrest in 2008 .
he said : `` this defendant should not be connected to these offences . ''
police expert analysis of the cctv footage had not even been able to confirm the make and model of the vehicle , he said , and the car later impounded by police was not even registered to mr jordan .
the solicitor also questioned the police 's reliance on the nitroglycerin trace , saying the bomb used in the attack had been made of semtex .
the judge refused mr jordan 's application for bail .
he is due to appear before strabane magistrates ' court via videolink on 17 december 17 .
