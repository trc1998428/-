it follows a decision by the city 's three further education colleges to join a national pay bargaining system .
members of the eis union at other colleges across scotland are due to strike on tuesday and wednesday in a separate dispute over pay .
the glasgow lecturers may now be balloted to decide if they join future action in the wider pay dispute .
the glasgow lecturers had joined a one-day strike on thursday , prior to the local pay bargaining dispute being settled .
eis general secretary larry flanagan said a `` u-turn '' by the glasgow colleges marked a `` significant early victory in the campaign for fair pay in all scottish colleges '' .
he said : `` the glasgow colleges had refused to sign up to the national bargaining process , in the mistaken belief that this would remove them from their obligations on a fair pay offer .
`` the strike action by our members has forced a quick change of mind on the part of the glasgow colleges , and the eis welcomes this development today . ''
mr flanagan added , `` while these glasgow disputes are now settled the national action in pursuit of a fair national pay offer and pay equality in all colleges will continue .
`` two days of strike action in this campaign are planned for next week , and these will take place in all colleges where lecturers have been balloted as part of the national dispute .
`` lecturers in the three glasgow colleges , who are not currently part of the national action , will now be re-balloted as soon as possible to allow them to join their colleagues across scotland in future strike days as part of the national campaign for fair pay . ''
