the queen , who turns 90 this week , is still `` full of laughter '' , mrs rhodes told bbc radio 4 .
she also has a sense of humour when things go pear-shaped , and enjoys telling amusing tales , her cousin said .
`` she can tell very funny stories of things that have happened to her where things might have gone just a fraction wrong , '' mrs rhodes told the pm programme .
one such tale might include the time she met a shopper in sandringham who did not recognise her and declared that she looked just like the queen , prompting the monarch to remark : `` how very reassuring '' .
ms rhodes said the queen 's vocal talents were not confined to the east of england , and years spent at balmoral in aberdeenshire meant she is also able to do an impressive scottish accent .
