steven souley , 26 , and his accomplice zico malavin , 20 , were remanded in custody after they admitted attacking robert eadie , 25 , in glasgow in 2014 .
the victim required surgery to repair a wound to his groin and penis after being hit with an axe and knife .
souley was previously jailed for seven years for killing a man in 2010 .
sentence on both accused was deferred at the high court in glasgow after they admitted assaulting mr eadie to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement .
the court heard that the attack happened at a christmas party hosted by mr eadie 's sister at her flat in the city 's summerston area .
souley and malavin , who were not invited , turned up at about midnight .
souley was armed with an axe and malavin - who was wearing a red christmas jumper - was clutching a knife .
mr eadie 's sister , who knew the pair , demanded that they leave .
her brother was attacked after he tried to put them out of the flat .
souley and malavin both fled the scene and police and paramedics were called .
a knife and a christmas sweater were later found at a property linked to souley .
it was months later that the pair were charged .
the court heard that mr eadie needed an operation to repair a `` deep wound '' to his groin and to his penis .
he also suffered injuries to his head and hand .
he was released from hospital days later , but will be permanently scarred .
souley and malavin , both from the city 's drumchapel area , will be sentenced next month .
souley was jailed in 2011 after being convicted of the culpable homicide of 41-year-old andrew curran .
in may 2014 he was deemed safe enough to be freed early .
zico malavin 's brothers were both found guilty of murder over the attack on mr curran .
angus malavin was jailed for 18 years and younger brother zak for 17 years .
mr curran died from a sword wound to the neck .
the fatal park attack happened following a row over a bottle of buckfast .
a fourth malavin brother , kris , was jailed for seven years in 2014 after he tried to run down and kill a key witness in the murder trial .
