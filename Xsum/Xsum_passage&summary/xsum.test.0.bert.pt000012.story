and many of those communities will have voted labour .
for years this was a party heartland which was home to big beasts like tam dalyell and robin cook .
before his death , mr cook had a majority of more than 13,000 - he commanded the support of more than half of the electorate .
but much has changed here .
the mines are closed , the economy is now focussed on some remnants of small industry , retail and elsewhere .
livingston and its surrounding towns often acts as feeders for edinburgh .
robin chesters is director at the scottish shale industry museum .
`` there are still communities here who remember those days , '' he says , `` it 's the parents , it 's the grandparents - but in places like livingston there have been tremendous changes in population . ''
the labour candidate here is a vocal supporter of jeremy corbyn .
and she thinks the labour leader 's message is appealing to voters .
`` i think for a long time communities like this were taken for granted the snp had something really positive to offer - that was independence .
but we 've now seen the reality , '' she says , referring to a perceived lack of progress under the snp scottish government .
the choice , she says , is clear : a labour government or a conservative government .
`` i think that 's cutting through . ''
some here though do n't seem to mind the idea of a conservative government all that much .
the tories here are buoyed by local election results and national opinion polls .
their candidate thinks he is in with a good chance of beating ms wolfson - putting the party once seen as the enemy of miners above labour for the first time in modern history here .
damian timson says : `` there are two types of conservatives - there 's this bogeyman conservative that people talk about and then there 's the real conservative ; the likes of myself and ruth davidson and everyone else and i think at last the message has got out that we 're a party for everyone . ''
but this seat was won comfortably by the snp in 2015 - hannah bardell took even more of the vote that robin cook had back in 2005 -lrb- she won 57 % of the vote - a majority of almost 17,000 -rrb- .
`` people have found that the snp have been a strong voice for them in livingston - i 've done everything in my power to raise constituency issues on the floor of the house , '' she says .
`` there has certainly been big changes in livingston .
but what west lothian and livingston have been very good at doing is bouncing back - and what the snp have offered is support for the new industries . ''
the lib dem candidate charlie dundas will be hoping he improves on his showing from 2015 - when the party won just 2.1 % of the vote - losing its deposit and finishing behind ukip .
`` there 's only one party that is standing up for the two unions that they believe in - livingston voted to remain in the uk back in 2014 ; livingston voted to remain the eu . ''

@highlight

the five sisters in livingston are an imposing reminder of west lothian 's industrial past - huge mounds of discards from the old shale mines that once dominated the economy - and community life - here .
