paulo roberto costa - who is in jail and being investigated for involvement in the alleged scheme - named a minister , governors and congressmen .
among them were members of the governing workers party and groups which back president dilma rousseff .
but the names , published in a magazine , also included rivals of ms rousseff .
many of the names were published in veja , one of brazil 's leading magazines , just weeks before the presidential election in which ms rousseff is running for a second term in office .
several politicians mentioned have denied involvement .
mr costa claimed that politicians received 3 % commissions on the values of contracts signed with petrobras when he was working there from 2004 to 2012 .
he alleged that the scheme was used to buy support for the government in congressional votes .
mr costa was arrested in 2013 .
he is now in jail and struck a plea-bargain deal with prosecutors before giving the names .
ahead of the election , ms rousseff 's approval ratings have been slipping in opinion polls in favour of her rival , former environment minister marina silva .
the bbc 's wyre davies in rio de janeiro says the latest allegations could hurt the incumbent further , as during her presidency petrobras has dramatically underperformed and its costs have risen sharply .
it has become one of the world 's most indebted oil companies and lost half of its market value in three years .
the bbc has requested a comment from petrobras about the latest allegations and is awaiting a response .
