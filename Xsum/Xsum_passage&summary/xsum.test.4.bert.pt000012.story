in february 2016 ministers said funding would stay at # 6.7 m in 2016-17 , whilst s4c 's remit and funding was reviewed .
mps urged ministers to drop plans to cut their contribution to # 6.1 m as the review had not yet begun .
culture minister matt hancock said secretary of state karen bradley was considering the matter .
most of s4c 's # 80m budget comes from the licence fee .
the wales office does not expect the investigation to be completed until the end of 2017 .
during a westminster debate on wednesday , mr hancock said the department of culture , media and sport 's contribution to s4c 's budget was currently set to fall to # 6.1 m in 2017-18 .
`` we are aware of commitments given by our predecessor -lsb- ex-culture secretary john whittingdale -rsb- around timing - and this is an issue the secretary of state -lsb- karen bradley -rsb- is currently considering , '' he said .
ceredigion mp mark williams , who called the debate on s4c 's future , said : `` it is absolutely right that a review takes place to ensure that it has the funding necessary to fulfil its remit and strategy over the longer term .
`` the comprehensive review into s4c announced in february last year , by the former secretary of state , along with a reversal of a cut , prior to the outcome of the review , was welcome .
`` but we are now in 2017 and still waiting for a promised review , and there is cross-party concern about the delay . ''
mr hancock said there would be an announcement about the review `` shortly '' and promised that it would be chaired by someone with `` a thorough understanding of wales and an interest in the welsh language '' .
