in his first prime-time speech on a specific policy issue , the republican leader will address the nation at 21:00 local time -lrb- 01:00 gmt -rrb- .
he said he had reached a decision after reviewing war options with his national security team at camp david .
mr trump once called for a full us pullout from afghanistan .
he announced a strategic review soon after taking office in january .
so what can the president do when he addresses the nation ?
option 1 : he could pull out all 8,400 us troops and let the afghans get on with it .
that could be popular at home and would be consistent with what donald trump has previously said .
but it would leave a dangerous vacuum to be filled not just by afghan rebels , but also by embryonic islamic state affiliates which are taking hold in the east of the country .
option 2 : he could pull out a large number of us troops and deploy private contractors to continue the work of advising and assisting the afghan military , in effect outsourcing the job .
that 's not likely to be popular with the afghan government , and washington would still get the blame if things did not work out .
option 3 : and this seems the more likely one .
he could send more troops -lrb- up to 4,000 the best guess -rrb- to bolster the training of more afghan security forces and perhaps add to the american special forces who are involved in the fight to expel is related groups .
whatever he decides , analysts will be looking for something that amounts to a strategy and not just a change in tactics and that will probably have to involve drawing other countries in the region , such as pakistan and russia , into the discussion .
he will deliver his first major national security address at a military base next to arlington national cemetery , where many of the 2,200 us troops who have died fighting over 16 years of war in afghanistan are buried .
mr trump is also expected to outline a more aggressive us counter-terrorism policy for afghanistan and pakistan .
earlier this year , the president empowered defence secretary jim mattis to set troop levels in afghanistan .
general john nicholson , the top us military commander in the country , has requested some 4,000 additional us forces .
he told afghan troops at a training base southeast of kabul on sunday : `` we are with you and we will stay with you . ''
us combat operations against the taliban officially ended in 2014 , but special forces have continued to provide support to afghan troops .
current us troop numbers in afghanstan are about 8,400 .
the afghan government continues to battle insurgency groups and controls just half of the country .
mr trump has previously supported pulling troops out of the conflict , which began under president george w bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks .
`` i took over a mess , and we 're going to make it a lot less messy , '' mr trump said when asked about afghanistan earlier this month .

`` we 're not winning , '' he told advisers in a meeting in july .
his defence secretary has argued a us military presence is necessary to fight off threats from islamist militants .
mr mattis visited afghanistan over the weekend , saying he was satisfied with the administration 's new strategy .
former white house strategic adviser steve bannon had called for the withdrawal of all us forces , arguing the war was unwinnable .
but he was fired by the president on friday .

us president donald trump is expected to indicate later that he is sending more troops to afghanistan , prolonging a war-weary america 's longest conflict .
