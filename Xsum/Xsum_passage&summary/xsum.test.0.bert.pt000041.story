five people are under investigation over the death of clement meric , 18 .
he was badly beaten in a clash between far-right and anti-fascist activists in paris on wednesday , and later died .
the paris prosecutor , francois molins said according to witnesses the two groups had run into each other by chance in a busy shopping district near st lazare train station , where a fight broke out .
he said the arrested suspects claimed to have responded to provocation by the left-wing group .
all five suspects went before a judge on saturday , two days after they were detained .
according to the prosecutor , the main suspect named esteban , 20 , was being investigated on suspicion of murder .
`` the -lsb- suspect -rsb- named esteban acknowledged to police that he had struck clement meric twice - bare-fisted , he claimed - including the blow that caused him to fall to the ground , '' mr molins said .
other witnesses said `` esteban '' had worn a knuckle-duster .
`` a friend of clement meric said he saw him with a knuckle-duster , while another witness at the scene referred to a ` shiny object ' in his hands . ''
two sets of knuckle-dusters had been found at his home , the prosecutor added .
the teenager was placed on life support but was declared brain dead and died on thursday .
french president francois hollande said he condemned the attack `` in the strongest terms '' .
france has seen increasing tension between left and right , following a fierce debate over the introduction of same-sex marriage .
the jnr is the militant wing of a far-right movement known as the third way .
it has denied any link to the brawl .
its leader , serge ayoub , has been questioned by police following the killing but is not a suspect .
but mr molins said on saturday that all the suspects under investigation had ties to the third way .
only one , a young woman named katia , was said to have admitted being a member , he added .
prime minister ayrault said in a statement : `` i have asked -lsb- interior minister manuel valls -rsb- immediately to begin the procedure ... to proclaim the dissolution of the revolutionary nationalist youths . ''
the government has vowed to crackdown on fascist groups .
mr valls said : `` sadly such movements are resurging ... racists , anti-semites and homophobes '' .
france 's main far-right party , the national front , described the killing of mr meric as `` appalling '' .
