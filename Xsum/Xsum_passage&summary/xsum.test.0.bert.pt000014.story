satellite images taken on 14 february appear to show two batteries of eight missile launchers and a radar system on woody or yongxing island in the paracels .
the presence of missiles would significantly increase tensions in the acrimonious south china sea dispute .
china 's foreign minister wang yi said reports were a western media invention .
but mr wang defended `` the limited and necessary self-defence facilities '' on islands inhabited by chinese personnel as `` consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection ... .
under the international law '' .
asked about the reports , us secretary of state john kerry attacked china 's increased `` militarisation '' of the contested region , saying it was a `` serious concern '' .
taiwan 's defence ministry said it had `` learned of an air defence missile system deployed '' by the chinese on woody island .
it would not say how many missiles had been deployed or when , but told the bbc they would be capable of targeting civilian and military aircraft .
the commander of the us pacific fleet confirmed the deployment to reuters news agency .
adm harry harris said such a move would be `` a militarisation of the south china sea in ways '' china 's president xi jinping had pledged not to make .
japan 's chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said there were `` serious concerns '' over china 's `` unilateral move to change the status quo '' in the region , and `` we can not accept this fact '' .
china has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region , which it says is legal and for civilian purposes .
but the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory , and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised .
the latest images of woody island were captured by imagesat international .
they show a close-up of a section of beach , the shape of which resembles the northern coastline as it appears on other images , and point out two missiles batteries .
each battery is made up of four launchers and two control vehicles .
two of the the launchers appear to have been erected , says the report .
an image taken of the site on 3 february shows the beach empty .
fox news quoted a us defence official as saying the missiles appeared to be the hq-9 air defence system , with a range of about 200km -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- .
china 's deployment of long-range surface-to-air missiles to the south china sea is a clear escalation , but it is not a surprise .
nor is it china 's first deployment of advanced military technology to woody island -lrb- yongxing dao -rrb- .
last november , photos appeared on the internet of chinese j-11 fighter jets landing on the newly-enlarged runway there .
sending the missile batteries now could be a warning to vietnam , or a response to the us navy , which sailed a missile destroyer past woody island at the end of january .
so far beijing has been careful not to put any weapons on its newly-constructed islands further south , in the spratly group .
that would be much more provocative .
last month beijing even sent two civilian airliners to land on its newly-completed runway at fiery cross reef .
it was a good publicity stunt .
but no one should be in any doubt that the true purpose of those new islands and their new runways is also military .
the news comes as south east asian regional leaders end a two-day meeting in california where south china sea had been a topic of debate .
us president barack obama said the members had discussed the need for `` tangible steps '' to reduce tensions , including `` a halt to further reclamation , new construction and militarization of disputed areas '' .
rival countries have wrangled over territory in the south china sea for centuries , but tension has steadily increased in recent years .
its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by taiwan , china , vietnam , the philippines , malaysia and brunei .
china has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols , while the us says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides , but seen by many as aimed at china .
the frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences .
although largely uninhabited , the paracels and the spratlys may have reserves of natural resources around them .
there has been little detailed exploration of the area , so estimates are largely extrapolated from the mineral wealth of neighbouring areas .
the sea is also a major shipping route and home to fishing grounds that supply the livelihoods of people across the region .
