a head teachers ' conference has heard claims of threats such as dead animals being left in school playgrounds .
`` trojan horse has not gone away , '' said sarah hewitt-clarkson , head of anderton park school in birmingham .
responding to the claims , education secretary nicky morgan said : `` there is no place for extremism in our schools . ''
the national association of head teachers ' annual conference in liverpool heard warnings that problems over extremism remained unresolved and schools could still face pressure on issues such as tackling homophobia .
the so-called trojan horse inquiries followed allegations that there were organised attempts by hardline muslim groups to undermine head teachers and take over schools in birmingham .
head teachers at the conference complained that no governors had been barred as a result of the inquiries and they called for a database which would identify individuals removed from governing bodies .
ms hewitt-clarkson told the head teachers ' conference : `` trojan horse has not gone away .
those of us who were involved , we knew it was the tip of the iceberg .
`` we still have dead animals hung on the gates of schools , dismembered cats on playgrounds .
we have petitions outside schools , objecting to teachers teaching against homophobia . ''
there were threats on social media , she said , such as `` any head teacher who teaches my children it 's alright to be gay will be at the end of my shotgun . ''
ms hewitt-clarkson said she knew of a school which had found a dismembered cat in the playground , while another had a dog hanging from the railings .
head teachers warned that despite the high profile reports following the trojan horse claims , the response had been inadequate .
alison marshall told the conference : `` despite all the evidence we have , we 're faced with a situation where not one single governor implicated in the trojan horse scandal has been investigated or even banned .
where is the justice in that ? ''
and ms hewitt-clarkson warned that the problems underlying the trojan horse claims could `` start up again '' .
`` all the behaviours and things we saw before are still there .
so too have promises that have been broken , '' she told the naht conference .
there were particular concerns about the lack of scrutiny over the role of governors , highlighted by the trojan horse inquiries .
tim gallagher told delegates the lack of regulation meant it was `` blindingly obvious '' that there would be problems with governing bodies .
`` many , many of our members have suffered greatly from rogue governors , '' he said .
the conference carried a motion calling for a national register of governors who have been removed or barred so that schools and local authorities can check the suitability of governors .
the bbc revealed earlier this year that there is no central record of governors held by the department for education , which would also show people serving as governors in multiple schools , one of the concerns raised in the trojan horse inquiries .
mrs morgan , responding to the heads ' warnings , said : `` there is no place for extremism in our schools and we continue , absolutely , to work to eliminate any form of extremism . ''
but the conservative education secretary said : `` this is a reminder that this is a serious issue and something that is not going to be solved overnight .
`` we have taken action to remove and continue to take action to remove people from being in schools who do n't follow british values . ''
