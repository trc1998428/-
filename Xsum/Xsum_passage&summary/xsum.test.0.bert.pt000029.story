sevilla , winners of the tournament in 2014 and 2015 , led early on through vitolo 's close-range strike .
marlos equalised with a composed finish from 18 yards before taras stepanenko headed the ukrainian side in front before half-time .
but kevin gameiro 's late penalty earned the spaniards a draw .
the french attacker showed no signs of nerves , converting confidently from the spot after facundo ferreyra fouled vitolo just inside the area .
the result leaves sevilla on course for a third consecutive europa league success , with the two away goals making them firm favourites to advance to the final in basel .
no team has won three consecutive european titles since bayern munich achieved the feat 40 years ago , and if unai emery 's side progress from next thursday 's second leg in spain , only liverpool or villarreal stand between them and a piece of history .
the first leg of that tie ended 1-0 to villarreal .
sevilla have not won away from home all season in la liga and have managed just one victory on their travels in this competition , so a draw in lviv represents a fine achievement .
but their home form is excellent - they have won 14 of 18 league games at their ramon sanchez pizjuan stadium - meaning their bid to become the first team to win the europa league three times in a row remains very much alive .
