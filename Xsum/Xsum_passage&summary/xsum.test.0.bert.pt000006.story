fast forward about 20 years , and it 's fair to say he has done just that .
the business he runs , frasers hospitality , is one of the world 's biggest providers of high-end serviced apartments .
its 148 properties span about 80 capital cities , as well as financial hubs across europe , asia , the middle east and africa .
but it almost did n't get off the ground .
when mr choe was appointed to launch and lead the company , asia was booming ; the tiger economies of hong kong , south korea , taiwan and singapore were expanding rapidly .
but as frasers prepared to open its first two properties in singapore , the asian financial crisis hit .
suddenly , people were losing their jobs and stopped travelling .
mr choe recalls asking staff if they really wanted to continue working with the firm , because when the properties opened they might not get paid .
`` it was really that serious , '' he says .
`` i remember tearing up because they said ` let 's open it , let 's open it whether you can pay us or not ' . ''
survival , mr choe admits , came through a bit of luck , and the misfortune of others .
he had convinced the board at parent firm , property group frasers centrepoint , to open serviced apartments rather than hotels - partly because getting planning permission in singapore was easier .
but he also sensed it was a big , untapped market .
and at the time of the crisis , it proved to be exactly what customers wanted .
`` as we were going through this difficult patch , there were protests and riots in jakarta , '' he says .
`` a lot of companies like microsoft called up looking for rooms for their staff because they were moving out of jakarta . ''
frasers ' 412 apartments were quickly in demand .
occupancy soon hit 70 % , and then 90 % .
explaining the popularity of serviced apartments , mr choe says that if people are staying somewhere for just a few days , they happily stay in hotels , but if they are going to be somewhere for one month to eight months , the walls of hotel rooms `` close in on you '' .
but now , mr choe , 57 , faces new challenges - the travel tastes of millennials and the disruptive nature of airbnb .
`` the way to tackle airbnb is not to ignore it .
i will never underestimate airbnb , '' he says .
there 's been no significant impact on frasers yet .
big corporations still prefer to put employees in big service apartments , he says , because they can guarantee a level of safety and security .
but that is likely to change , mr choe admits .
`` i have two daughters who to my chagrin use airbnb , '' he says .
`` we took a family trip to florence and i stayed in this wonderful boutique hotel , but paid a bundle for it .
`` when my daughter joined us , she said , ` i 'm just staying next door and paying about 80 euros ' .
we paid about 330 euros .
`` i asked why they stayed at airbnb .
they say ` it 's like a surprise , it 's part of the adventure ' . ''
and so now , mr choe wants to bring some of that vibrancy to frasers .
while neutral colours , beige curtains and dark wooden chairs dominate its more traditional apartments , many customers want something different , and this is shaping fraser 's strategy .
in 2015 it bought malmaison hotel du vin , a uk hotel group that specialises in developing heritage properties into upscale boutique hotels .
that has taken them beyond financial centres , including to shakespeare 's hometown of stratford-upon-avon .
or , an intrepid traveller with $ 500 -lrb- Ã¢ # 325 -rrb- to spend could have a night in a converted medieval prison in oxford .
and frasers has launched the capri sub-brand - whose website promises `` inspiring art and inspirational tech '' .
on a day-to-day basis mr choe says he still draws on his experience as a young man , who - having been given a scholarship by the shangri-la hotel group to study at cornell university in the us - came back to asia to learn about the hospitality industry .
`` they put me in every department conceivable .
i remember one of the toughest jobs i had was in the butchery .
i had to carve an entire cow .
for one month , i could not eat meat .
`` i 'm thankful for those experiences .
when you step into a hotel , you immediately pick up what works and what does n't work .
`` when i see the check-in staff walking more than three steps , i know the counter is set up wrong .
`` it 's like a cockpit .
can you imagine if the pilot had to turn around when he flies ? ''

mr choe adds that loyalty is very important to him , and he remains tremendously grateful to staff who have stayed with him .
`` i will always respect and remember those who gave up their jobs to join me , '' he says .
this loyalty is something that mr choe has earned , according to donald maclaurin , associate professor at singapore institute of technology , and specialist in the hospitality sector .
mr maclaurin points out that mr choe introduced a five-day working week , in a part of the world where six days is common , thereby showing `` a focus on quality of life issues for employees '' .
the associate professor adds says the early success of the business was remarkable given the timing of its launch .
fast forward to today and the company is now on track to operate 30,000 serviced apartments globally by 2019 .
that success , say mr choe 's admirers , should make him something of a visionary .
