first-half tries from jonny may and courtney lawes were matched by a near-identical pair by george ford and owen farrell in the second period to overwhelm the visitors .
england had failed to beat the springboks in their previous 12 meetings over 10 years , but after a grand slam in spring and whitewash of australia in summer , the autumn has begun with more history being made .
inspired by a note-perfect display from scrum-half ben youngs , this performance was further undeniable evidence of the vast improvement made under the wily jones .

just over a year ago , england were knocked out of the world cup they were hosting at the group stage , a mile away from competing with the best in the world .
now only new zealand are ranked ahead of them , that status entirely deserved despite the obvious room for further improvement .
after an early penalty and drop-goal from south africa 's pat lambie , england showed their ambition , ford using elliot daly as a decoy runner in midfield off quick line-out ball to put marland yarde and mike brown in space , may finishing in the corner with trademark speed on his return to the side .
but the springboks ' power was hurting england , with six penalties conceded in the first 20-odd minutes and clean line-breaks made by both props .
lambie 's second three-pointer regained the lead for the visitors at 9-7 .
gradually , england found the balance between pragmatism and adventure .
youngs ' kicking and sniping helped regain the initiative , farrell landed a penalty and then the men in white struck again .
with the ball going through hands again daly kicked long from inside his own half , may forced jp pietersen into a fumble , brown kicked on and second row lawes dived on the loose ball as it rolled over the try-line .
farrell added the conversion and then daly marked the occasion of his first england start with a monstrous penalty from halfway for a lead of 20-9 at the interval .
now it was england with the power , billy vunipola sucking in tacklers with his carrying , the springboks ' defence stretched and then fatally weakened .
youngs spotted space around the fringes on the opposition 22 , beat blind-side flanker pieter-steph du toit with an outrageous dummy and found ford on his right shoulder to put his fly-half away for their side 's third try .
south africa came into the match having lost four of their past five games , and shipped a half-century of points at home to the all blacks in their last outing .
a breakaway try from replacement johan goosen briefly gave them hope , but when youngs foxed du toit with a replica dummy to send farrell away , england 's authority was once again absolute .
willie le roux crossed late in the left-hand corner to underline england 's need to tighten their defence .
but in difficult conditions , this was an accomplished display , and with fiji in london next weekend , jones will expect that flawless record to be extended further still .
a perfect scrum-half 's performance in conditions like this - precision box-kicking , snappy passes to his big ball-carriers , picking the ideal moments to snipe and break .
england captain dylan hartley : `` there 's plenty to work on , so that keeps us grounded .
we conceded six penalties in the opening 20 minutes and that is n't good enough .
but we 're very happy to get that monkey off our back and i 'm very proud of our guys . ''
south africa captain adriaan strauss : `` it was a very tough game , they were tactically very good and we could n't deal with the high ball .
we just could n't put any pressure on the england team and we felt it the whole game .
we 'll have a hard look at ourselves on monday and we 'll fight back . ''
