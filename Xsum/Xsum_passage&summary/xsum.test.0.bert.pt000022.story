bhs.com will employ just 84 people , a fraction of the 11,000 who lost their jobs after efforts to find a buyer for the high-street business failed .
the last of bhs 's 163 department stores was closed last month .
the new website , which is owned by the qatari al mana group , will go live in the uk on thursday .
`` we are nimble and efficient , but with a great brand , strong customer base and a proven and dedicated team , '' said david anderson , the managing director of the new online operation .
mr anderson added that the website would have `` a number of advantages over a typical start-up '' , including an `` iconic '' brand and a loyal customer base in the uk , including 1.2 million former online shoppers .
bhs.com will sell roughly 75 % of the items available on the former online shop , including bedroom , bathroom , cushion and lighting ranges .
the new owner of bhs ' online shop , qatari conglomerate al mana group , already works with a number of high-street brands , such as zara , mango , united colours of benetton and reebok .
mr anderson said an all-new online technology platform had been developed for bhs , `` so we are not inheriting any legacy systems '' .
he said the majority of people who worked for the previous bhs online operation had been recruited for the new business .
