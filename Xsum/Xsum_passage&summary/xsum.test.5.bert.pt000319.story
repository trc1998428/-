striker diego costa went off injured for atletico early on and barcelona capitalised as alexis sanchez smashed in a superb opener .
atletico came out strong in the second half as david villa hit the post before diego godin headed an equaliser .
barcelona would have won the title with a win and dani alves went close with a fierce drive , but atletico held on .
the final whistle was greeted by wild celebrations from the atletico players and coaching staff , while the entire nou camp stood to applaud diego simeone 's side as they finally ended the barcelona-real madrid duopoly in spanish football .
the draw meant atletico finished first with 90 points , three ahead of barcelona and real .
it completed what has been a superb season for atletico , which has seen them take victory at city rivals real , as well as win nine league games in succession to go top of the table in march .
their run faltered slightly towards the end , as they lost to levante and drew at home to malaga , but they went into the game against barcelona knowing a point would be enough to win the title .
if that gave atletico players any psychological advantage , it was swiftly eradicated when simeone 's side lost two of their key players inside the opening 20 minutes .
their first casualty was costa .
the striker , with 27 goals in the league this season , had only just returned to the side after missing last week 's draw with malaga , and he lasted just 14 minutes before his hamstring went after a brief sprint .
costa limped off in tears and just seven minutes later it got worse for the visitors .
arda turan , so often the creator of atletico 's better moves this season , landed on his back awkwardly when challenging for possession and he too was unable to continue .
to atletico 's credit , they did not let that double blow disrupt them as they managed to keep barcelona at arm 's length , whilst also threatening occasionally themselves .
atletico 's tiago directed a header over the bar from koke 's inviting cross , before pedro missed with a similar attempt for barcelona soon after .
there had barely been a shot on target in the first half hour but it was a moment of brilliance from sanchez that gave barcelona the lead .
cesc fabregas curled a ball into the box for lionel messi who , with his back to goal , chested the ball into the path of an onrushing sanchez , who smashed a first time effort from the tightest of angles just inside the top right of the atletico goal .
the half-time whistle provided simeone the chance to offer words of encouragement to his players , and whatever he said evidently worked as the visitors made a storming start to the second half .
villa 's shot on the turn struck the post , before the former barcelona striker saw a low , left-footed effort saved by pinto , but their pressure paid dividends just five minutes after the restart when gabi whipped a corner into the middle of the area where godin rose highest to send a bullet header low into the back of the net .
barcelona needed to regain the initiative if they were to successfully defend the league title and the balance of play quickly swung back in their favour , with the visitors seemingly content to soak up pressure and try and hit the hosts on the counter .
messi , quiet for large periods of the game , had the ball in the net midway through the second half , but the argentine 's effort was ruled offside , before alves struck a shot from distance that seemed destined for the top corner , only for atletico keeper thibaut courtois to react superbly to push the ball over his goal .
the atletico players held their nerve to keep barcelona at bay in the final 10 minutes before the final whistle confirmed their status as league champions .
with one trophy secured , simeone will now switch his attention to the champions league , with atletico taking on real madrid in the final on saturday , 24 may .
