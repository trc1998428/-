innogy renewables uk ltd had been proposing a hydroelectric scheme on the river conwy , near betws y coed in snowdonia national park .
but on wednesday it said it had decided to shelve the conwy falls project .
the application had been due to be considered by conwy council planning committee next week .
innogy renewables uk said the decision to withdraw the application was made following a late request for additional information .
it said that natural resources wales ' river basin management plan for western wales had been updated last december , including a change to the sensitivity of salmon fisheries , following which further information had been requested .
the project , providing power to 3,200 households , attracted opposition from environmentalists , anglers , canoeists and businesses .
the firm has previously said it would have had a positive impact on the environment but campaigners were worried half an acre of the centuries-old fairy glen wood would be destroyed by the build .
in march , the park 's authority turned the plans down , asking for clarification on `` minor issues '' .
innogy renewables uk ltd said it would now consider its next steps .
conservation charity the snowdonia society said it was `` relieved that the immediate threat to the wonderful conwy falls and fairy glen has passed , but concerned that it could resurface yet again '' .
