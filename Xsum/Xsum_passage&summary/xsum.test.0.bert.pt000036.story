jack beales , 93 , of rhyl , carried out the attacks while she was a young girl , mainly when he was in his 70s .
he denied five charges of rape and six other sexual offences but was unanimously convicted by the jury at mold crown court on 9 december .
sentencing him on wednesday , judge rhys rowlands said beales had destroyed his victim 's childhood .
his victim , now aged in her 30s , took to the witness stand to read her victim impact statement .
the court heard the abuse began when she was aged six and continued for about 10 years .
she said she had wanted to commit suicide and hoped , when she confronted beales last summer , it would bring some kind of closure .
but she said it had not and she was still on strong medication for depression and anxiety , and was awaiting counselling .
the court had heard she confronted beales at his home and he admitted in front of her mother and his wife he had groped her as a child .
he later said `` that was what men did '' .
the woman said every time she came into contact with beales he made hurtful comments .
she said : `` once again i felt suicidal and felt i could not continue suffering while he was living a happy and carefree life , with no apparent suffering . ''
the woman said one of her biggest wishes in life was to start a family .
but she added : `` i worry that there may be internal physical damage due to the abuse which may mean i am unable to conceive or carry a child to full term . ''
she said she felt she could not trust anyone and saw the world `` as a very dangerous place '' .
`` i am hyper vigilant when kids are left unattended or unsupervised around men , '' she told the court .
`` i feel unable to relax , and as though i have a responsibility to be watchful over others . ''
defending barrister andrew green said beales had no previous convictions and accepted some acts had taken place but he denied other allegations including all the rapes .
jailing him , judge rowlands said beales did not have `` an ounce of remorse '' and was `` devoid of any moral compass at all '' .
he will have to serve a further 12 months on licence .
det insp william jones , of north wales police , said : `` john -lrb- jack -rrb- beales was a manipulative and depraved sexual predator who committed multiple offences over a sustained period of time .
he is now thankfully behind bars .
`` no child should ever have to experience what the victim went through . ''
an nspcc wales spokesman said the victim `` must be commended for showing incredible bravery in reporting what happened to her so beales could eventually face justice for his crimes '' .
