scientists used information about the geology of the country to predict the areas most likely to be affected by the poison .
the report is published in the journal science .
arsenic occurs naturally in the earth 's crust , but if it leaches into groundwater , long-term exposure can cause serious health risks .
these include skin problems and cancers of the skin , lungs , bladder and kidney .
until now , estimating the scale of arsenic contamination in large countries has been difficult .
china is thought to have more than 10 million drinking wells , and each needs to be screened to establish whether any toxic compounds are present .
this process could take decades .
instead , researchers from switzerland and china looked at geological maps of the country .
dr annette johnson , from the swiss federal institute of aquatic science and technology -lrb- eawag -rrb- and a co-author of the study , explained : `` in the last few years the amount of geospatial information - electronic maps - that 's become available is large .
you have information such as climate data , land use , and distance to the river or elevation . ''
using this information , and by looking at the types of rocks present in the country , and in particular their age , the researchers pinpointed the regions where the toxic element is most likely to be found .
their findings suggest that 19.6 million people in china could be exposed to unsafe levels in their drinking water , including some living in areas areas not previously thought to be at risk .
dr johnson told the bbc world service programme science in action : `` they are areas along river basins where there is irrigation and agriculture , including areas that were known previously such as the huhhot basin in inner mongolia , but there are also new areas in the central sichuan province and along the east coast . ''
the researchers say the findings could help the chinese authorities with their well-screening programmes .
dr johnson explained : `` what it is very important to do is to go to the areas that are hotspots and screen those first .
the chances are you will find more contaminated wells than wells that are not contaminated .
`` and in the other areas , you still have to make sure you do screening for arsenic , but it is probably not such a high priority . ''
wells that are contaminated could be either treated or taken out of use , she added .
the researchers believe this new prediction method could used elsewhere around the world .
arsenic contamination of groundwater is found in central europe , south america , parts of the us and asia .
but one country that could benefit is bangladesh , where arsenic poisoning has been described by the world health organization as a `` public health emergency '' .
it is estimated that between 35 million and 77 million people there are at risk of drinking contaminated water .
