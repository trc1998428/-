the labour leader said his party would invest in infrastructure but expected action on low wages and workers ' rights in return , while there would also be an increase in corporation tax .
he told the cbi that labour 's planned `` national investment bank '' would boost lending to small and medium-size firms .
the tories said labour only offered `` spending , borrowing and taxing '' .
mr corbyn told delegates at the cbi 's conference he would not tell them how to run their organisations but would not `` stand back when there is injustice in the workplace or the boardroom '' .
he warned of `` real problems '' in today 's jobs market , citing low wages , insecure temporary contracts and the gender pay gap .
`` for too many families in britain increasingly insecure work means they can not plan for their future , or how to pay the bills , mortgage or rent , '' he said .
`` there are far , far too many people struggling to make ends meet '' .
mr corbyn joked he and the cbi would both have been `` shocked '' if they had been told two years ago he would be addressing the conference .
but he said labour had `` plenty of common ground '' with the organisation .
he vowed labour would be `` on the side of the innovators , entrepreneurs and investors '' , saying its investment bank plans would `` unleash the creativity and potential of entrepreneurial britain '' .
he said both the brexit vote and the election of donald trump in the united states represented `` an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system which has n't been working for most people .
`` it 's a system that 's delivered ballooning inequality along with falling or stagnating living standards for the majority . ''
labour says it would increase borrowing to invest in infrastructure , and mr corbyn urged chancellor philip hammond to `` change course and take the bold action necessary to support our economy '' .
he said labour would increase investment in green technology and boost house building .
labour 's `` settlement for business '' , he said , `` will mean some increase in corporation tax while maintaining one of the lowest rates in the world '' .
he added : `` but see it as a sound investment not only in your own business 's long-term future but for the common good of the country . ''
mr corbyn also warned of a `` chaotic '' brexit and said labour would campaign for britain to `` retain full access to the single market '' .
conservative party chairman sir patrick mcloughlin said : `` jeremy corbyn has shown once again that all labour offer is a recipe for economic ruin , while they 're totally out of touch with the public 's concerns on immigration as we leave the eu . ''
prime minister theresa may addressed the cbi earlier , announcing Ã¢ # 2bn of annual investment in research and development by 2020 and an industrial strategy aimed at spreading economic growth across the uk .
