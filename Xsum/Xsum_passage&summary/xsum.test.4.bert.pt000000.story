of the 863 men who died , an estimated 120 , known as `` the jersey pals '' , were killed during the battle of the somme .
made from jersey granite , the memorial stone was officially unveiled by bailiff william bailhache in the french village of guillemont .
the delegation from the island also included the lieutenant governor , chief minister and the dean of jersey .
ian ronanye , an author and historian , said the memorial would be a permanent reminder of the role jersey played in the great war , although part of it would return to the island .
