horror stories have been handed down the generations about the mysterious site , known as deadman 's island , so the bbc 's inside out south east programme took a boat across to investigate whether any of the rumours were true .
lots of people have since been talking about it on social media sites .
here are the answers to six things you wanted to know .
where is deadman 's island and who owns it ?
it lies at the mouth of the swale , opposite the town of queenborough on the isle of sheppey , off the north kent coast .
the uninhabited mudbank is owned by natural england , who lease it to two people .
the wetland site is protected land , and is a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and recognised to be of international importance under the ramsar convention .
it is also an important bird breeding and nesting site .
no , the island is completely out of bounds to the public .
the inside out team was only allowed to visit after receiving permission from the leaseholder and because it was not the bird breeding season .
who were the people buried there ?
the remains are believed to be those of men and boys who died of contagious diseases on board floating prisons , known as prison hulks , which were moored off the isle of sheppey more than 200 years ago .
they were buried in unmarked coffins in six feet of mud .
why are their remains being exposed ?
rising sea levels and coastal erosion over the years have begun to slowly wash away their final resting place , leaving wooden coffins and skeletal remains sticking out of the mud .
they are only visible when the tide is out .
will the bodies be reburied ?
the remains are being washed out into the sea , and would be difficult to re-bury .
coincidentally , during the napoleonic wars , many french prisoners of war were held around the coast at chatham , with those who died buried on the nearby marshes .
when erosion started to reveal the bodies , they were exhumed and reburied on st mary 's island .
when the land was later needed for redevelopment , they were disinterred again and reburied at st george 's church , now the st george 's centre , at chatham maritime .
have archaeologists visited the island ?
kent archaeologist dr paul wilkinson was taken to the island by inside out , and confirmed the bones were human remains .
it is not known if any archaeologists have surveyed the area as nothing has been made public .
you can see the full story on inside out , on bbc one south east and london on monday 30 january at 19:30 gmt , and later on the bbc iplayer .
