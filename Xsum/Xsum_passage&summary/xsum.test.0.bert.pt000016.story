he will be joined in the big red chairs by long-serving judge will.i.am , oscar-winning actress and singer jennifer hudson and rock star gavin rossdale .
sir tom said : `` i had some great times on the show and i ca n't wait to again discover and help some brand new talent .
and of course be back with my pal will.i.am . ''
