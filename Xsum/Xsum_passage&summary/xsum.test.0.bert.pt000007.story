margaret aspinall and trevor hicks campaigned for more than 20 years to secure fresh inquests into the deaths of 96 people in the disaster .
mr hicks ' daughters sarah , 19 , and victoria , 15 , and mrs aspinall 's son james , 18 , were among those who died at the fa cup semi-final in april 1989 .
mrs aspinall , chair of the hillsborough family support group , said she would accept it on behalf of the families .
a jury is currently hearing the new inquests in warrington before coroner lord justice goldring .
mrs aspinall said : `` it 's not just about trevor hicks and margaret aspinall , it 's about everybody involved in this .
it 's all about the people who stood by us .
`` from the beginning , when you are fighting against everything , nearly 26 years ago , you had this stigma against you all the time , fighting against that , i feel we have turned it all around now and the stigma is going away .
`` people are seeing now , the real people , what the genuine people are like , and the people who stood by the families and stayed with them all these years , so it 's for them as well . ''
mr hicks , president of the hillsborough family support group , said : `` on a personal level , obviously i 'm very flattered .
i know it 's a bit cheesy but i 'm also a bit humbled as well .
`` it 's not just for me .
as it says in the citation , it 's for services to the bereaved families .
`` it 's been a hard slog .
we 've been accused many times of being vindictive - and lots worse than that .
but we 've always tried , as a family support group , to play fair . ''
