if prime minister theresa may does not appear to have had a particularly good night , ruth davidson , the tory leader in scotland , certainly has .
the scottish tories have seen double-digit increases in their vote in almost every seat .
they 've more than doubled their returns in some places where the party was previously unelectable .
first they knocked off angus robertson , the snp 's deputy leader and top dog at westminster .
they had called that their `` portillo moment '' - but their best was yet to come , as they dethroned alex salmond in gordon .
they even overturned the fourth-safest seat in the country , in banff and buchan .
other scottish tory gains include :
it 's been a long time since the tories have had a night like this in scotland .
in four elections in a row , they returned a single mp .
the year before that , 1997 , they got zero .
you have to go back to 1992 for the last time they won more than a single seat in scotland .
they ended up with 13 - the party 's best showing north of the border since 1983 .
what this tory resurgence means for the rest of the uk in terms of parliamentary calculations is unclear .
the margins are razor-thin , so every seat is precious .
but the tories are resolute in what they believe it means for scotland .
`` indyref2 is dead , '' ms davidson says .
the prospect of a second independence referendum has been at the core of the tory campaign , and indeed their entire revival in scotland .
the snp have a majority of seats , and thus a `` triple lock '' mandate for that referendum , according to their manifesto - but it certainly seems a more distant prospect than ever .
and while mrs may 's future might now be in doubt , ms davidson 's star is burning more brightly than ever .
