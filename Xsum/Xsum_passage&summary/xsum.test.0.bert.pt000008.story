alongside the likes of little simz and lady leshurr , she 's part of a groundswell of female voices in the male-dominated world of uk hip-hop and grime .
two years ago , the 23-year-old was studying for a degree while working 12-hour shifts in a betting shop to make ends meet .
she would scribble down lyrics in her spare time as her male contemporaries - section boyz , bonkaz and her cousin stormzy - were starting to break through .
realising the job was holding her back , she packed it in and started to make her name with her savage , witty lyrics and sense of fun .
her breakthrough video , station , was shot , without permission , at a local railway station , with nadia dancing nonchalantly on the tracks as a train pulled in .
more recently , the colourful , funky single skwod saw the rapper take over the streets of london with a girl gang , complete with body-popping beyonce choreography and all .
she spoke to the bbc about her upbringing in croydon , the rappers she looks up to , and why she read the dictionary as a child .
for people who have n't heard you , describe what they 're missing .
my sound is just really bassy , hard-hitting , dancehall , hip-hop infused fun .
your lyrics have proper punchlines .
yeah , quite a few !
do you work hard on them ?
it varies , depending on what it is i 'm creating .
a lot of the time i do n't even write the bars .
it 's all in my head , really .
apparently you used to read the dictionary as a child ?
that is true , yeah !
what 's your favourite word ?
it 's one of the longest words in the english language .
have you ever tried to get it into a song ?
i 've been asked and i 'm definitely working on it !
it might not fit on a single cover , but it could definitely fit in a lyric .
what triggered your interest in words ?
it was learning about synonyms that did it for me .
i was like , `` wow , you can use another word to mean the same thing as this word ? ''
it just went crazy from there .
when did you first perform in public ?
ooh ... the first time i performed in public ?
to be fair , growing up i was always performing .
it did n't have to be on a stage .
it could be a family event and i would just make it about me , somehow .
going up in a lift , on the side of a road , wherever .
one of your teachers said you were the most entertaining pupil she ever had .
yeah , that was touching ... and actually , i do agree .
there 's a fine line between `` entertaining '' and `` troublemaker '' .
how often did you end up on the wrong side ?
some days it did tip over into what some teachers would call `` disruptive '' .
but i thought it was creative .
what did you study at university ?
it was very helpful when signing my deal - because there were things i definitely would n't have had a clue about prior to taking that course .
at the same time as studying , you were working at a betting shop and making music in your spare time .
did you get any sleep ?
all my free time was up in the studio .
i just had a feeling i was giving music my spare time , rather than my time .
it got to a point where it felt very weird and i thought , `` this is all the wrong way round .
i 'm getting too comfortable at work and keeping music as a little side thing . ''
i needed to give it my all to actually get the results that i wanted .
your dad was an mc too .
how instrumental was he in your musical education ?
he played a huge part in all of this .
he had quite an eclectic music taste , but there was loads of sizzla , buju banton , a lot of the old-school reggae guys .
that 's where that part of my musical personality comes from .
who were the mcs you listened to growing up ?
in terms of mcs and rappers , it was definitely a lot of the hip-hop legends , like busta , eminem , missy , lil kim .
but i was n't just inspired by mcs .
i was a huge spice girls fan , too .
they called me wavey spice !
-lsb- wavey is london slang for cool/good . -rsb-
there were n't many female mcs in the uk to look up to .
well , there was ms dynamite .
seeing what she was able to achieve was inspiring .
how do you feel about the current wave of female mcs ?
it 's a good time and hopefully it 'll continue to build .
why do you think it 's happening now ?
i bringing them with me !
i saw a freestyle you recorded for sb : tv where you said you 'd been told to `` get naked and wear thongs '' to sell records .
was that based on real experience ?
it 's from personal experience as well as people that have told me stories .
as women in this male-dominated field , we 've all been approached with something along those lines at one point .
it happens , but we have to be able to overcome it .
i need to ask about the video to station ... i was worried you might die on the train tracks .
a few people were , including my mum .
it was literally by chance that we survived .
there was no real planning .
we did n't even get permission .
recently i found out we got the train times wrong .
the train that would have been coming on the other side was actually due at the time we got off the tracks ... we thought we had a good five minutes spare , but we had seconds .
the other notable thing about that video , and skwod too , is how much charisma you have .
were you always a natural in front of the camera ?
i 'm in my element .
i 'm doing the thing i love and i 'm being able to share that with people .
this summer , you got to go to rio for a grime showcase at the british embassy .
just to be part of the olympics was extra-special , again with my squad .
i look forward to going again .
you 'd expect the british embassy to choose something more boring , like sting ...
well , i 'm actually a huge sting fan .
i would n't call him boring , but i get what you mean .
it was definitely good to bring my sound over there .
so what 's your plan for 2017 ?
it 's going to be filled with a lot of music , a lot of visuals .
if you thought this year was the nadia rose takeover , you have no idea !
what 's your biggest ambition ?
i definitely need a grammy under me belt .
to bring a grammy back to croydon , how would that be , eh ?
nadia rose 's debut album highly flammable is released on 13 january by sony/relentless records .
