lee , who died last year , is revered by singaporeans , while his children are respected members of the establishment .
his son , lee hsien loong , is prime minister .
the family had presented a united front , but that cracked in recent days when lee wei ling , a prominent doctor and newspaper columnist , publicly objected to what she saw as excess in the one-year commemorations .
she also accused the government - led by her brother - of exploiting his legacy for its own gain , which prime minister lee has rebutted .
the exchange has shocked singaporeans - public disputes among the establishment in this tightly controlled city are extremely rare , let alone one involving the country 's equivalent of the royal family or the kennedys .
it has also fed into ongoing discussions on the tricky issue of how best to remember lee kuan yew , a beloved idol who hated being one .
lee 's death on 23 march last year prompted a massive outpouring of grief among singaporeans who queued for hours to pay their respects , surprising even government officials .
at least 100 events were organised for the one-year anniversary , ranging from solemn ceremonies and a candlelight vigil to tree-planting and kayaking events .
wax statues of lee - widely known as lky - and his wife were put on public display with flowers laid at their feet , a schoolbook teaching lee 's values was launched , while some ardent fans online even claimed to have seen his face in the clouds .
two days after the anniversary , amid unease in some quarters about the commemoration 's intensity , ms lee posted a disapproving piece on facebook arguing that her father would have objected .
`` any veneration could have the opposite effect and lead future generations of singaporeans to think that my father 's actions were motivated by his desire for fame , or creation of a dynasty .
he strove hard and determinedly in life to advance singapore , and not for his place in history , or leaving a great legacy , '' she wrote .
she later accused the government of wanting to `` glorify my father '' , and alleged that a newspaper was doing the government 's bidding by refusing to publish the piece unedited .
the paper , the straits times , strongly denied her claims of censorship .
in a now-deleted post of an exchange with the paper 's editors , she wrote that her brother `` has no qualms abusing his power to have a commemoration just one year after lky died ... if the power that be wants to establish a dynasty , lky 's daughter will not allow lky 's name to be sullied by a dishonourable son . ''
one sunday , the prime minister released a statement saying her accusations were `` completely untrue '' , adding that his government felt the level of commemoration and activities `` were generally appropriate '' .
in singapore , lee 's admirers face the dilemma of how to honour a famously unsentimental figure who sternly disapproved of any worship - he refused statues and monuments in his name , and wanted his home to be eventually knocked down to prevent it from becoming a shrine .
in a 1984 interview , lee had made clear his objections to the idea of a personality cult in singapore , saying : `` the danger ... is that when the leader dies , you are faced with the difficult problem of finding another . ''
the lee siblings ' squabble has divided public opinions , with many taking to their facebook pages to weigh in .
some agreed that the tributes bordered on the excessive and were disrespectful .
`` if he does n't want to be hero worshipped then we should n't no matter what singaporeans want .
lky has already given a lot to us .
let him rest in peace , '' said commenter mohammad nizam abdul kadir .
`` the best way we can remember him is to continue as a united , multi-racial , progressive country .
uphold his values and principles , '' said another called mano sabnani .
but others argued that the round of commemoration activities was necessary for citizens , many of whom still feel a personal connection to lee .
`` i am one of the many who wanted to express my gratitude to him and also to remember him for his commitment and contributions to singapore .
i would humbly ask ms lee wei ling to at least indulge us as we miss him too , '' said daniel ng .
carol sim said : `` ms lee has failed to understand that lky does not belong to her alone .
he belongs to the people of singapore .
we respect your choice to remember your father in your own quiet way but you certainly can not stop the people from wanting to do more . ''
