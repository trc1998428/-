liberty , headed by sanjeev gupta , was first to express an interest in the assets when they were put up for sale .
a spokesman for liberty told the bbc that the firm had put together a team of advisers and financial backers .
`` the formal process is to submit a letter of intent ; it amounts to a bid .
it will be done on tuesday , '' he said .
in addition to the port talbot factory - the uk 's largest steelworks - tata 's remaining assets include sites at newport , where more than 1,300 people are employed , and rotherham , which employs 1,200 .
tata also has operations at corby , shotton and teesside .
macquarie , the australian bank , was advising liberty on a potential bid , and is considered a potential financial backer of any takeover .
liberty house started life in the university room of indian-born founder sanjeev gupta .
while a student at cambridge university in 1992 , the budding entrepreneur started what has since become a global steel and commodities business with annual sales of more than # 2bn .
with operations in 30 countries , and headquarters in london , dubai , and singapore , mr gupta 's liberty has also emerged as a possible saviour of britain 's steel industry .
liberty 's focus is on recycling the mountains of scrap metal generated in the uk , rather than the historical method of producing steel in blast furnaces .
last month , it acquired tata steel 's plants in lanarkshire .
in recent years , it has reached similar deals for steel plants in newport and the black country .
a management buyout team is also planning to submit a bid under the name excalibur steel uk limited .
it has appointed investment banker mark rhydderch-roberts as a non-executive director .
he joins stuart wilkie , the head of tata 's united kingdom strip steel business , and former alcan senior executive and venture capitalist roger maggs , on the board .
the government has promised to support any buyer of the business by taking up to a 25 % stake in a new business and making hundreds of millions of pounds of finance available .
tata has not publicly set a deadline for any deal , but has made it clear it can not sustain its # 1m-a-day losses indefinitely and does not want to prolong the uncertainty for workers and customers .
tata 's scunthorpe operation , which employs more than 3,000 people , has been sold to investment firm greybull capital for a nominal # 1 .
