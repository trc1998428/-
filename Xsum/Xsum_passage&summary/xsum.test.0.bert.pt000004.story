the sunday times says the missile veered off course during a test in june last year - weeks before the commons voted to spend # 40bn renewing trident .
questioned by andrew marr , the pm refused to say four times if she had known about the test ahead of the vote .
the snp 's nicola sturgeon called for a `` full disclosure '' of what happened .
according to the sunday times , an unarmed trident ii d5 missile veered off in the wrong direction towards the us - instead of towards africa - when it was launched from a british submarine off the coast of florida .
in july - days after mrs may had become prime minister - mps voted overwhelmingly in favour of replacing trident .
during the debate , mrs may told mps it would be `` an act of gross irresponsibility '' for the uk to abandon its nuclear weapons .
mps backed its renewal by 472 votes to 117 .
however , all 52 snp mps voted against it - as did labour leader jeremy corbyn .
when asked on the bbc 's andrew marr show whether she had known then that a misfire had happened , mrs may said : `` i have absolute faith in our trident missiles .
`` when i made that speech in the house of commons , what we were talking about was whether or not we should renew our trident . ''
she was asked a further three times - but did not answer the questions .
the ministry of defence did not give details of the test process but said it had been a success .
scottish first minister , mrs sturgeon - a long-standing opponent of trident , whose submarines are based at faslane , on the river clyde - said the apparent misfire was a `` hugely serious issue '' .
she tweeted : `` there should be full disclosure of what happened , who knew what/when , and why the house of commons was n't told . ''
meanwhile , mr corbyn said the reports called for `` a serious discussion '' .
he told sky news : `` it 's a pretty catastrophic error when a missile goes in the wrong direction , and while it was n't armed , goodness knows what the consequences of that could have been . ''
nia griffith , the shadow defence secretary , said it was `` completely unacceptable '' that mrs may had `` side-stepped '' questions .
she called for the prime minister to give `` a full explanation '' to parliament on monday .
admiral lord west , the labour peer and ex-royal navy officer , said it was `` bizarre and stupid '' to not tell anyone about the test .
the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- described reports of a misfire as a `` very serious failure '' .
`` there 's absolutely no doubt that this would have impacted on the debate in parliament on trident replacement , '' its general secretary kate hudson said .
a statement issued by both downing street and the mod said the capability and effectiveness of trident was `` unquestionable '' .
`` in june the royal navy conducted a routine , unarmed trident missile test launch from hms vengeance , as part of an operation which is designed to certify the submarine and its crew .
`` vengeance and her crew were successfully tested and certified , allowing vengeance to return into service .
we have absolute confidence in our independent nuclear deterrent . ''
the sunday times says the test fire was launched from hms vengeance .
it says the trident ii d5 missile was intended to be fired 5,600 miles -lrb- 9,012 km -rrb- to a sea target off the west coast of africa but veered towards the us .
the cause remains top secret , the paper says , but it quotes a senior naval source as saying the missile suffered an in-flight malfunction after launching out of the water .
hms vengeance , one of the uk 's four vanguard-class submarines , returned to sea for trials in december 2015 after a # 350m refit , which included the installation of new missile launch equipment and upgraded computer systems .
according to the sunday times , it is expected that defence secretary michael fallon will be called to the commons to answer questions from mps .
bbc defence correspondent jonathan beale said while the mod has described the test as a success for the crew and the boat , it has not denied the report that the missile itself might have veered off course .
in the past the mod has issued a press release and video of successful tests but its silence on this occasion has raised questions as to whether any fault was deliberately kept quiet ahead of the key vote , our correspondent added .
the trident system was acquired by the thatcher government in the early 1980s as a replacement for the polaris missile system , which the uk had possessed since the 1960s .
trident came into use in the 1990s .
there are three parts to it - submarines , missiles and warheads .
although each component has years of use left , they can not last indefinitely .
the current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the late 2020s .
