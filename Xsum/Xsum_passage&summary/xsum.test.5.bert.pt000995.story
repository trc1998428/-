the european space agency astronaut arrived at the orbiting space lab on monday , along with two crewmates from russia and america .
but what exactly will she be doing during her time in space ?
the iss gives the chance to do scientific experiments that can not be done on earth , as the station offers an environment of microgravity .
here we run through a few examples of the experiments on samantha 's ` to do ' list ...
samantha will operate a gadget called an electromagnetic levitator , which can heat metals to 2,000 â ° c and then cool them very quickly .
this will be a chance to see what happens to different metals when they go from liquid to solid , without the effect of the earth 's gravity .
it 's hoped the results will reveal more about the physics of the metals and how they work .
samantha will be testing new machine technology and how well they work in space , such as this astronaut joystick .
using a joystick in space may feel very different in space compared to on earth .
so these experiments will see how being in space might affect how well an astronaut can control a space robot or space machinery .
another thing is that equipment may need to be attached to the astronaut so it does n't float away .
the testing will also see what impact this has .
samantha will be doing lots of experiments to see how being in space affects her body .
for example , she will experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day on the international space station and be tested to see how this affects her body clock .
another important subject is food and energy .
experiments to see how much food an astronaut would need for a long mission will be carried out .
samantha will record what she eats and her energy levels over a period of time .
other things that will be looked at include how space affects skin and why many astronauts get headaches .
