nurseries increasingly focus on plants that can be mass produced so the big stores can sell them cheaply , he says .
`` you have these vast wholesale nurseries now supplying supermarkets - and that 's a diminution of choice , '' he told radio 4 's you and yours .
however , the horticultural trades association -lrb- hta -rrb- says supermarket sales actually help grow the market .
according to kantar world panel , nearly 40 % of gardeners get their plants , bulbs and seeds from supermarkets .

`` it 's rather like the vast suppliers supplying food - you get lots and lots of the same thing mass produced to be as cheap as possible . ''

the gardeners ' world presenter believes consumers should shop around .
`` i 'm a huge fan of independent nurseries .
that is where you get the expertise , it 's where you will find people who have devoted their life to growing something .
`` they will grow geraniums or trees and they will really know about it , so when you contact them , they can give you great help and assistance . ''
martin simmons , hta director of operations , said : `` people often make impulse purchases of plants in supermarkets and if this then encourages them to buy more plants then this is good for the industry and helps to grow the market .
`` buying a plant in a supermarket may be the first step for some consumers , particularly younger ones .
if this grabs their interest they will naturally seek out garden centres and retail nurseries . ''
