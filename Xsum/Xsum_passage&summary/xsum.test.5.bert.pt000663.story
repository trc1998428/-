they were last seen alive during a protest in the town of iguala .
police fired on them and rounded them up , eventually handing them over to members of the guerreros unidos drug gang , who are widely thought to have killed them .
but the students ' families refuse to believe they are dead .
they say they want more answers and will not give up looking for them .
so how can mexico move on ?
last week lourdes caballero sanchez took to the streets of the capital with thousands of other mexicans to call for justice .
it was a personal journey for her .
lourdes 's 21-year-old brother israel is one of the missing .
her belief that she will find him is unwavering .
`` i have an intuition that he 's still alive .
that 's why we are here , asking -lsb- president -rsb- pena nieto to give us back our boys , '' she told me .
`` as a sister , i 'm desperate .
i miss him , i want to see him .
i feel so powerless to not be able to do anything for him . ''
but less than 24 hours later , mexico 's attorney general jesus murillo karam delivered a blow .
he declared that the students were dead .
his team , he said , had interviewed 99 people including members of the criminal gang that he alleges murdered the students .
based on 386 declarations from interviewees , 16 police raids and two reconstructions , the conclusion was that the students were killed by the gang and their bodies burned at a rubbish dump .
the students ' families angrily rejected this scenario .
at a press conference held later in the day , one mother stood up and claimed that her son was not missing , he was being held by the government .
accusations that the government needs to be called to account have been flying at the same time that the authorities have been trying to draw this questioning to a close .
the prosecutor reassured the families the case would not be shut yet , but even president enrique pena nieto has said mexico needs to move on .
for many though , that is not an option .
`` i can understand the political logic of trying to put this behind the country , but i do n't think there are the objective conditions for the country to turn the page , '' says independent security analyst alejandro hope .
`` the government has provided a narrative of what happened but has n't yet provided an explanation .
in the absence of a detailed version of why , this case will not be closed . ''
the war on drugs has taken a brutal toll on mexico in the past decade .
more than 100,000 people have been killed and the latest official figures put the number of missing at 23,271 .
this week , some of the parents of the missing students travelled to geneva to appeal for help from the united nations committee on enforced disappearances .
mexico 's national human rights commission also published a report ahead of the visit .
commission president luis raul gonzalez perez criticised the impunity in mexican society , which he believes dates back to the 1970s and 1980s : decades when the government and left-wing student groups clashed with deadly results .
he gave several recommendations to be discussed at the un 's sessions , one of which was a more systematic database of the missing to understand the true extent of the problem .
one of the big concerns among human rights groups is that although many of the suspects arrested have been charged with kidnapping and murder , none have been charged with the crime of enforced disappearance .
`` it reflects that the mexican government is reluctant to recognise that in mexico enforced disappearances occur , '' says denise gonzalez , of the miguel agustin projuarez human rights centre .
`` they are trying to water down their responsibilities .
they are reluctant to recognise that state officials have engaged in enforced disappearances in mexico . ''
in a country used to the high number of dead in the drug war , this case of the ayotzinapa students has stood out .
the feeling , say experts , is that these young men should not be viewed as collateral in a narco-war .
it has forced people to push for change .
`` the majority of mexicans are now empowered and feel a personal responsibility to change things in the country , '' says john m ackerman , a law professor at mexico 's national autonomous university .
`` this is an invaluable achievement since it implies an historic break with the learned pessimism and passivity encouraged daily on the principal television and radio networks in mexico . ''
their disappearance has forced the government to make changes , too .
in november , president pena nieto announced plans to put all local police units under federal control and allow congress to dissolve local governments infiltrated by drugs gangs .
but with mid-term elections later this year , there are question marks as to whether these sweeping announcements will all get voted in .
`` it was a watershed moment for mexican society , maybe , '' says alejandro hope .
`` but a watershed moment for government policy ?
i do n't think so . ''
despite the feeling of stalemate among many , the investigation is not over yet .
the inter-american commission on human rights -lrb- iachr -rrb- signed an agreement in november with the mexican government and representatives of the disappeared students to look into the events of ayotzinapa .
they will be holding their first meeting later this month .
there are still many questions surrounding the students ' disappearance .
the hope is that perhaps the iachr will provide some answers to try and prevent another ayotzinapa from ever happening again .
