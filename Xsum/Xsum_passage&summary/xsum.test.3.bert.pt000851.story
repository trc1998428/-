`` the rules of the game are changing , '' the prime minister declared .
and he launched a 12-point plan of tough measures to deal with the threat of terrorism .
i can remember writing them all down in my notebook and wondering when this bewildering list of policies was going to end .
opposition parties protested they had not been consulted .
the then labour chairman of the home affairs select committee dismissed the policies as `` half-baked '' .
and mr blair went on holiday leaving his home secretary , charles clarke , to pick up the pieces .
day after day , there were emergency news conferences as the policies were clarified , rewritten and embellished .
some were quietly forgotten - such as new powers to close mosques - and others provoked divisive parliamentary battles , such as allowing the police 90 days to detain terror suspects without charge .
the attacks transformed the politics of the summer .
but the key point is this : mr blair had already won his third election in may with a healthy majority of 66 .
in contrast , theresa may is dealing with her terrorism while the election campaign is still going on .
for the prime minister , there are several lessons she could take from the experience of her labour predecessor .
anti-terror laws made up on the hoof in the heat of the moment are not always the best ones .
and laws do not always help .
since 2000 , there has also been a lot of counter-terrorism legislation passed by parliament and yet the threat is still there and very real .
yet mrs may clearly felt the need to say something in downing street in response to the london bridge attack that went beyond the usual condemnation of the violence , sympathy for the victims and their families and praise for the security forces .
the fact that she announced some policy prescriptions showed that , in her mind , the need to be seen to being doing something outweighed the inevitable criticism of politicising the reaction to the incident .
and , of course , a four-point plan was better than mr blair 's 12 .
this was a recognition by the prime minister that security is now a significant issue in this election .
long after the rows of this campaign are over the government that is elected will still be facing the threat of islamist terrorism .
where once the last few days of the election might have been focused on brexit or tax or spending , much time and space will now be devoted to police numbers , intelligence capacity and extremist ideology .
it is a political truism that security issues tend to favour the incumbent , allowing the prime minister of the day to look and be prime ministerial .
it lifts them temporarily from the petty partisan point-scoring to the olympian heights of statesmanship and all that a downing street podium can confer upon them .
in times of uncertainty , the status quo looks attractive .
as belloc rhymed , `` always keep a-hold of nurse for fear of finding something worse '' .
yet for mrs may this is a double-edged sword .
her security background gives her the experience and knowledge to sound convincing and credible on counter-terrorism .
yet it also gives her opponents a record to attack and ask what on earth she has been doing as home secretary over the past seven years to tackle the threat .
has she , for example , been increasing or cutting police budgets ?
security is also double-edged for jeremy corbyn .
these attacks have allowed his opponents to revive past comments revealing his reluctance to use armed force , to accuse him of consorting with members of the ira , and to remind voters of his opposition to many counter-terrorism laws .
but the issue also allows the labour leader to surprise voters with a counterintuitive promise to give the police full authority to use force .
it also gives him space to question some of britain 's alliances with countries in the middle east from where some islamist ideology originated .
the truth is that the impact of such incidents on elections is not straightforward .
in israel , for instance , what are considered to be terror attacks tend to favour parties of the right over parties of the left .
but the evidence elsewhere appears inconsistent and sketchy .
the terror attack in paris this april did not help the front national leader , marine le pen .
but in spain in 2004 , the attack on madrid 's commuter trains that killed 192 people - just three days before polling - did not help save the ruling centre-right popular party from defeat .
the bottom line , perhaps , is that many voters in britain will have seen terrorism before .
and they will see it as just one issue among many on which they can base their vote .
they also know that elections are about choosing a government for potentially five years and knee-jerk decisions are not always best for the long-term .
