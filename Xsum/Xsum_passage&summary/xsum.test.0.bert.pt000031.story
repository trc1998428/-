shafiq mohammed was also found to have resisted arrest at a demonstration in monkton , south ayrshire , in 2015 .
the 50-year-old former scottish refugee council worker was said to have verbally abused a woman and three men .
however , the sheriff did not formally proceed to conviction of the accused in respect of the charges .
at ayr sheriff court , sheriff weir said he would consider a submission from mr mohammed 's lawyer under section 246 of the criminal procedure -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 1995 when a further hearing is held in december .
he adjourned the case for the preparation of a criminal justice social work report .
during the court case , the sheriff heard how tempers flared as members of the far-right anti-immigration scottish defence league staged a counter demonstration against pro-refugee demonstrators on 15 november last year .
it followed 150 refugees being granted emergency accommodation at the ayrshire town 's adamton country house hotel .
mr mohammed was said to have shouted that the group were `` nothing but white bastards '' .
he denied behaving in a racially aggravated manner which was intended to cause alarm and distress .
mr mohammed claimed the four witnesses had conspired to make up the allegations against him .
sheriff robert weir qc found that mr mohammed had behaved in the manner outlined in the charges but opted to reserve his verdict , adjourning the case until december .
he said it had been a `` troubled case '' and said the atmosphere at the rally had been `` rendered toxic by other people '' .
the sheriff told mr mohammed his actions were `` to be deplored '' .
the court heard mr mohammed had previously worked for property firm orchard & shipman , which has been paid more than Ã¢ # 60m to house refugees in scotland .
he is currently involved in the asylum seeker housing -lrb- ash -rrb- project - an organisation campaigning on asylum seeker housing issues in the west of scotland .
