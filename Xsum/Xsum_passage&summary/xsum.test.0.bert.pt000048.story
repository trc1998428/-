llanbedr airfield , near harlech , is one of eight which has been looked at .
gwynedd council says it would support the development , but the snowdonia society is opposed to the impact it could have on the wider national park .
the views of local people will be sought if the site is identified as a serious contender for the role .
by the year 2030 the global space economy is expected to be worth â # 400bn a year and the uk government wants to secure a slice worth â # 40bn annually .
but it needs a port from where it is thought satellites and space tourism flights will be launched , prompting the consultation .
six of the locations under consideration are in scotland and one in england .
gwynedd council leader dyfed edwards said if realised the plans have the potential to create `` significant economic development and the growth of both the local and national economy '' at llanbedr aviation centre and enterprise park .
`` as a council , we are delighted that the llanbedr airfield site has been selected as one of eight possible locations for the uk spaceport , '' he said .
`` and we have written to the uk government to confirm that we would fully support the development of the site as the location of the uk spaceport .
`` the llanbedr site has a great many attributes which would make it an excellent choice , from the fact that it would be possible to use an existing airfield facility in a secure costal location where a spaceport could operate safely , to its close proximity to both aberystwyth and bangor universities , both of which have expertise in fields relevant to space technology . ''
he said the authority would continue to work with the airfield owners and the welsh government to exploit the site 's potential .
but not everyone agrees with the proposed location , including some local residents and the snowdonia society - a charity set up to `` protect , enhance and celebrate snowdonia , its wildlife and heritage '' .
society director john harold said : `` whilst we support and want to see appropriate development in the park , we feel that something like a spaceport would bring levels of impact on wildlife , on noise and disturbance and other issues that would not be appropriate for the national park .
`` we already have a world class facility here .
we already have a world famous brand .
it is called snowdonia national park and it is a real success . ''
the uk department for transport expects to the publish a response to its consultation later in the year .
