no windfarm at gayton -lrb- nowag -rrb- and east lindsey district council both oppose the planning application .
the protest march on sunday morning raised money for legal costs as well as highlighting the campaign .
the developers say wind turbines contribute to renewable energy targets and help combat climate change .
but campaigner melvin grosvenor , who is working with nowag , questioned how efficiently the turbines would generate energy .
`` it 's a huge price for lincolnshire to pay to host a suspect technology , '' he said .
`` the developers say we need renewable energy , but at what cost to the landscape ? ''
earlier this year lincolnshire county council issued a statement advising district councils not to grant planning permission if wind farms fail to meet strict criteria .
the council 's leader , martin hill , said he did not want lincolnshire to be `` covered by a forest of the things '' .
mr grosvenor said wind turbines have more of a visual impact in lincolnshire because the landscape is relatively flat .
`` the issue we 've got with lincolnshire is because it 's predominantly big open skies there are few visual detractors , and of course you 've got the lincolnshire wolds -lsb- an area of outstanding natural beauty -rsb- , '' he said .
about 60 campaigners walked from near theddlethorpe church to great carlton , and many were sponsored .
they walked along a bridleway known as the two mile bank , where the turbines would be erected .
the campaigners also flew a blimp at about 377ft -lrb- 115m -rrb- to demonstrate the maximum height of the turbines .
there are already wind farms at gayton le marsh and theddlethorpe , and mr grosvenor said the proposed turbines would `` give the impression of a continuous line of turbines on the landscape . ''
the public inquiry is due to begin in january and the government will decide whether permission is granted or not .
developer energiekontor said on its consultation website : `` the uk is the windiest country in europe and the deployment of wind farms could contribute significantly to renewable energy targets which aim to assist in combating climate change . ''
