`` huge frustration , i 'm certainly disappointed with the outcome .
i thought we were so good for so long with and without the ball .
`` i thought we were outstanding in the first half and i think in the second half even though swindon had all the football .
on the counterattack we were really good , we just lacked that little bit of quality and ruthlessness in the final third .
`` if you do n't see the game off - and it 's a very dubious penalty against you , about the softest penalty i 've seen for a long time - you 're backs-to-the-wall a little bit . ''
