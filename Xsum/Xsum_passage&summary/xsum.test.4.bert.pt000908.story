the plane came down en route to russia from the resort of sharm el-sheikh .
a group linked to so-called islamic state -lrb- is -rrb- said it bombed the plane .
nearly all the victims were russians .
russia has said a bomb brought down the metrojet airbus , after finding what it said were `` traces of foreign explosives '' on the debris .
it has vowed to `` find and punish '' the perpetrators .
in response to monday 's findings , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov re-iterated that `` our experts concluded this was a terrorist attack '' .
russian plane crash : what we know
russia suspended all flights to egypt in the wake of the attack , with the uk also suspending flights to and from sharm el-sheikh .
however , the head of the egyptian committee investigating the crash , ayman al-muqaddim , was quoted by state tv on monday as saying there was `` no evidence that there is an act of terror or illegal intervention '' .
is-affiliate sinai province said it had destroyed the plane because of russian air strikes on syria .
last month is 's magazine published a photo of what it claimed was the improvised bomb that brought down the airliner .
the picture in dabiq showed a schweppes gold soda can and what appears to be a detonator and a switch .
the crash has dealt another blow to egypt 's vital tourism industry , already struggling after years of unrest .
egypt 's tourism minister told reuters earlier this month that tourism revenues for 2015 will be at least 10 % below last year 's .
