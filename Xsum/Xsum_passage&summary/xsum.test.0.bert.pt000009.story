reports on wednesday suggested more than one iguana was actually filmed , with scenes then stitched together .
but the bbc has said only one animal was chased by the snakes - with other iguanas only filmed for close-ups .
the scene quickly went viral when it was aired last year and later won a bafta for must-see moment .
the iguana hatchling , filmed in the galapagos , eventually got away - much to viewers ' relief .
the daily mail claimed the episode was embroiled in a `` fakery row '' after producer elizabeth white told the media production show : `` it was n't the same iguana , no , and often we have to augment it with other clips .
`` unfortunately lizards , snakes and iguanas are n't good at ` takes ' . ''
but the bbc defended the sir david attenborough-fronted programme , with a spokeswoman saying : `` the bbc strongly refutes any suggestion that the award-winning iguana v snakes sequence was ` faked ' .
`` the final iguana chase in which one iguana escapes the snakes was - unusually for natural history filming - shot using two cameras , allowing us to follow both the individual iguana and the snakes ' point of view .
`` what was captured in the field was extraordinary animal behaviour which had never been witnessed or filmed before . ''
she added : `` as is common in natural history film-making , pick-up shots were filmed separately - for example close-ups of iguana eyes - to make the story of the sequence as clear as possible for the audience .
`` this is absolutely in keeping with the norms of natural history film-making - and absolutely in line with the bbc 's editorial policy guidelines , and was a true representation of animal behaviour . ''
other bbc nature documentaries have previously been accused of faking footage .
frozen planet , also fronted by sir david , showed footage of newborn polar bear cubs in a den with their mother in 2011 - but it was filmed in an animal park , rather than in the wild .
the bbc denied misleading viewers , with sir david saying it would have spoiled the atmosphere to point out where the filming had taken place adding : `` it 's not a falsehood and we do n't keep it secret either '' .
and then there was the blue planet footage shot in a lobster tank - but the bbc said this was done to protect the environment .
