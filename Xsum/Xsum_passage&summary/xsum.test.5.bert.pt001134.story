under a law aimed at reducing prison overcrowding , senior citizens -lrb- mr berlusconi is 77 -rrb- convicted of certain crimes can choose between house arrest and performing some socially useful task .
ordinary criminals can be assigned by the courts to work in centres for drug addicts , or soup kitchens for the homeless , or looking after the elderly .
but mr berlusconi is no ordinary criminal .
he normally travels surrounded by a cohort of bodyguards - which might slightly impede any voluntary work he undertakes .
he and his media companies also employ a small army of lawyers .
notwithstanding his final conviction by italy 's highest criminal court , the former prime minister still maintains that he is the innocent victim of politically biased judges .
nonetheless , he still faces a possible ban on holding public office , and later this month will almost certainly be stripped of his seat in the senate .
he was due to begin serving his sentence this week , but bureaucratic delays in the italian judiciary are legendary .
it now appears that no decision will be made by the authorities for at least six months as to how he is to pay off his debt to society .
the media mogul can propose what organisation he would like to join , but there is no guarantee that he will be assigned to the charity or the soup kitchen of his choice .
the italian media has had a field day reporting serious , and less-than-serious , offers .
a street circus in naples offered him a chance to go on stage and tell his own jokes .
mr berlusconi loves to entertain his friends in private with songs , and with jokes that are sometimes notoriously off-colour .
he began life as a crooner on board a cruise ship and he has written lyrics for his own songs composed and recorded by his close friend mariano apicella , a neapolitan entertainer .
a human rights group suggested that mr berlusconi could help them lobby international organisations for the abolition of the death penalty in countries where criminals are still executed .
a city in the north offered mr berlusconi a desk and an office to counsel business owners suffering from the economic recession .
gino strada , founder of emergency , an italian humanitarian organisation that provides medical services in war zones , including afghanistan and sudan , said mr berlusconi would be welcome to offer his services to them - although he added that perhaps they would keep him away from their accounts department .
meanwhile , a new way out for mr berlusconi has appeared on the horizon .
president giorgio napolitano is urging the government to pass a new amnesty law aimed at reducing the severe overcrowding in italy 's prisons , and mr berlusconi 's supporters are hoping that the measure might stretch to cover commuted sentences such as that given to the former prime minister .
for now , it is unclear whether the proposed amnesty could cover mr berlusconi 's community service , and it may be several months before the bill is decided on .
reform minister gaetano quagliarello , who belongs to mr berlusconi 's freedom party , says it would be `` unthinkable '' to exclude him from a measure that applies to all italian citizens .
justice minister anna maria cancellieri , on the other hand , said last week she did not think mr berlusconi could benefit from the measure .

former italian prime minister silvio berlusconi - whose four-year sentence for tax fraud has been reduced to 12 months under an amnesty - has submitted a formal request to perform a year of community service , instead of being confined to the gilded cage of one of his luxury homes under house arrest .
