mr turnbull said the titles were `` not appropriate '' in modern australia , and that queen elizabeth had accepted the cabinet 's recommendation to drop them .
former pm tony abbott reintroduced knighthoods and damehoods in 2014 .
his controversial decision to grant prince philip a knighthood in january was widely seen as one of the factors which ended his term as leader .
mr abbott at the time said australia was honouring the duke of edinburgh 's lifetime of `` service and dedication '' , but later said the decision was `` injudicious '' .
he was ousted as leader of the centre-right liberal party by mr turnbull in september .

the decision to give prince philip a knighthood was hugely unpopular in australia and seen as one of the biggest blunders of tony abbott 's brief time in office .
now the new prime minister malcolm turnbull , who in 1999 led australia 's unsuccessful campaign to abandon the monarchy and become a republic , has dropped knights and dames .
the prime minister will have the chance to discuss the matter with the duke of edinburgh 's son later this month , when prince charles comes to australia on a royal visit .
mr turnbull has recently said he remains a republican but says he does not regard the issue as a priority for his government .
end of ` knightmare ' poses republican question
in a statement , mr turnbull said the order of australia awards were `` an important way of honouring the achievements and service of many australians , including those unsung heroes who might not otherwise be recognised outside their local communities '' .
but he said his cabinet had recently reviewed the system and decided that the knighthoods and damehoods were `` not appropriate in our modern honours system '' .
existing knights and dames would not be affected by the change , he said .
the opposition labor party welcomed the move , with shadow treasurer chris bowen describing the titles `` a national disgrace '' .
but he said it was `` not appropriate '' for australia to be `` clinging onto imperial britain through our honours system '' .
`` we should n't be celebrating the fact that knights and dames are gone , we should be lamenting the fact that they came back under this government , '' abc news quoted him as saying .
however , monarchist groups in australia criticised the decision .
prominent australian monarchist david flint accused mr turnbull of trying to get `` revenge '' for the failed 1999 republic referendum , the sydney morning herald reported .
mr flint , the head of the australians for constitutional monarchy organisation , said scrapping the titles means australia ca n't give international recognition to its best soldiers , sportsmen and singers .
alongside prince phillip , three people have received the honour since 2014 - former new south wales governor marie bashir , former governor-general peter cosgrove and the former chief of the defence force angus houston .
australians rallied together online under the hashtag #knightsanddames to welcome mr turnbull 's announcement .
many agreed that this was a step forward for australia .
others felt there were more pressing issues to be dealt with .
