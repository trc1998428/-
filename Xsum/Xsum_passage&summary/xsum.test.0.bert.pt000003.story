the international tribunal for the law of the sea did , however , allow ghana to continue developing current oilfields .
these include the so called-ten fields , part owned by uk firm tullow oil .
ivory coast had asked that all drilling be suspended , but the tribunal ruled this would risk `` considerable financial loss '' to ghana .
instead , it told the west african nation to `` take all necessary steps to ensure than no new drilling either by ghana or under its control takes place in the disputed area '' and to `` refrain from granting any new permit for oil exploration and exploitation in the disputed area '' .
the area is believed to contain large reserves of oil , which both countries are keen to exploit .
pending a ruling on the precise maritime border , the tribunal told both countries to `` pursue co-operation and refrain from any unilateral action that might lead to aggravating the dispute '' .
the ruling was welcomed by tullow oil , which owns a large stake in the near $ 5bn -lrb- Ã¢ # 3.3 bn -rrb- ten project , which could reportedly produce up to 80,000 barrels a day .
`` following this ruling , the ten project can move ahead and we will now await instructions from the government of ghana with regard to implementing those provisional measures that have been ordered by -lsb- the tribunal -rsb- , '' a tullow spokesman said .
