the 36-year-old defender , who took up a coaching role at st james park last year , has not featured in city 's first team since the end of february .
`` regarding the playing , i know in my head that things are slowly coming to an end , '' he told bbc sport .
`` i 'm not knocking on -lrb- manager -rrb- paul tisdale 's door asking why i 'm not playing every week , that 's for sure . ''
butterfield has been at exeter for three seasons , having spent eight years at crystal palace , where he famously scored a six-minute hat-trick against wolves in the fa cup in 2010 .
`` at the minute it is a little bit of an emergency style usage of myself , '' butterfield added of his role within the exeter playing squad .
`` we 've not openly discussed where we 're going forward with that , i 'm sure next season it 'll be more coaching-based , with perhaps the registration still being held as a ` what if ' .
`` i 'm enjoying what i 'm doing with tis -lrb- tisdale -rrb- and the rest of the coaching staff and i 'm certainly enjoying working with the lads on the coaching front and i hope they 're enjoying working with me .
`` i 'm thankful to tis for giving me the opportunity to use the transition into the coaching .
`` it 's a win-win for both as tis uses me if and when and i 'm alongside him every day in training and close to the boys trying to get the best out of them . ''
