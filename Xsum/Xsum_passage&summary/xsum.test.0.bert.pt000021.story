leonie granger from gillingham , kent , was sentenced at the old bailey having been found guilty of manslaughter .
her boyfriend kyrron jackson , 28 , and his friend nicholas chandler , 29 , were found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years .
granger targeted mehmet hassan , 56 , in a mayfair casino in march last year .
judge william kennedy described the attack as `` pitiless and wicked '' , adding : `` it was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion . ''
granger 's lawyer orlando pownall said she only took part in the plot as she was in love with jackson and `` fell in with his desires '' and now `` deeply regretted '' her actions .
`` her head was turned by jackson , who she loved , and to some extent by chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming , '' he said .
but judge kennedy said she had been `` deceitful from the outset '' and had `` lost her sense and compassion '' when she got involved .
he added that she clearly cared more for jackson than he cared for her .
granger , who posed under the name of rachel , was wined and dined by the divorced father of three who boasted to friends he was not paying her to be with him , the court heard earlier .
on the night he was killed , mr hassan had taken granger to the upmarket nobu restaurant before giving her â # 1,000 to gamble with at the nearby palm beach casino .
the two were seen kissing passionately by a poker supervisor , before leaving the casino together for mr hassan 's flat in islington .
granger then let jackson and chandler into the poker player 's flat before leaving in a taxi .
both men tied up mr hassan with parcel tape and a neck tie before kicking and stamping him to death , the trial was told .
afterwards , while he lay dead in a pool of blood , all three were filmed on granger 's mobile phone throwing â # 50 notes around a room and even stuffing them in their underpants .
commenting on the footage , judge kennedy told the three defendants : `` the eloquence with which it speaks about you is deafening . ''
