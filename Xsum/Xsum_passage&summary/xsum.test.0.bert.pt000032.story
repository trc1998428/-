camilla bought a box of mangoes with a brixton Ã¢ # 10 note , introduced last year to try to keep the money of local people within the community .
the couple were surrounded by shoppers as they walked along electric avenue .
they came to brixton to see work which has started to revitalise the borough .
it was charles ' first visit to the area since 1996 , when he was accompanied by the former south african president nelson mandela .
greengrocer derek chong , who has run a stall on electric avenue for 20 years , said camilla had been `` nice and pleasant '' when she purchased the fruit .
`` she asked me what was nice , what would i recommend , and i said we 've got some nice mangoes .
`` she asked me were they ripe and i said yes - they 're from the dominican republic . ''
mr chong is one of 170 local retailers who accept the brixton pound .
customers exchange traditional pound coins for brixton pounds and then spend them at the market or in participating shops .
during the visit , prince charles spent time talking to youth worker marcus west , who works with children nearby on an estate off coldharbour lane .
mr west said : `` he 's on the level , really down-to-earth .
the prince is a lovely man . ''
he added : `` i told him i was working with young kids and he said , ` keep up all the good work . ' ''
prince charles also visited the railway hotel , at the invitation of his charity the prince 's regeneration trust .
the trust hopes to restore and refurbish the building , where once jimi hendrix and the clash played , as a new community and business centre .
