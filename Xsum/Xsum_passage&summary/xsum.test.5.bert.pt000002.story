mr matheson has served as a labour councillor in the city for 17 years - five of those as leader .
he stepped down from the leadership last september and was replaced by frank mcaveety .
a by-election will be held for his anderston/city ward , the date of which has yet to be confirmed .
mr matheson said : `` as a cities man , i am delighted to accept this prestigious appointment which comes at a perfect time for me .
`` having served as a city leader i am fortunate to be in a position to still contribute to the development of international cities in a non-political capacity . ''
mr matheson will be a visiting professor at strathclyde university 's institute for future cities - part of its economics department .
in his role he will be expected to write , lecture and assist with research projects across the uk and abroad .
the move appears to mark the end of mr matheson 's political ambitions for the moment .
last year he stood for the depute leadership of the scottish labour party and came second in the first round of voting .
he later decided against putting himself forward as a possible labour candidate for holyrood .
