police in madhya pradesh state told reporters sedition was `` hard to prove '' .
the men have been charged with `` disturbing communal harmony '' instead .
they were arrested after their hindu neighbours complained they had burst firecrackers during the game , which saw pakistan beat india by 180 runs .
senior police officer rr parihar said that an additional charge of conspiracy against the men would also remain .
`` it 's difficult to prove the sedition charge .
moreover , none of them has a criminal background , '' he told reporters .
the accused were sent to jail in the city of khandwa on tuesday .
meanwhile , amnesty international has called for the immediate release of the men , calling the arrests `` patently absurd '' .
sedition is one of the most serious charges under the indian penal code .
people charged with sedition have to surrender their passports , are not eligible for government jobs , must appear in court as and when required , and spend money on legal fees .
if found guilty , they could be sent to prison for life .
the india today website quoted police as saying that the men were charged because of the anti-india slogans and not because they were cheering for pakistan .
however family members of the accused have denied the charges against them .
`` we do n't know who burst crackers in support of pakistan .
all these charges against my son are fabricated , '' gulzar tadwi , the father of one of those arrested , told bbc hindi .
sikhander , who uses one name , said police had come in the night and taken away his sons without even telling them why .
he also denied that anyone in his house had cheered for pakistan .
this is not the first time indian muslims have got into trouble for cheering for the pakistan cricket team .
in 2014 , 66 muslim students from indian-administered kashmir were kicked out of their university in the northern state of uttar pradesh and charged with disturbing communal harmony .
and in 2016 , police were sent into a university in indian-administered kashmir after clashes between students from the state , the only muslim majority one in india , and other parts of the country .
