steelers coach paul thompson said the devils had an advantage , after their request to rearrange their elite league game 24 hours before the final was declined .
league rules state teams can not change fixtures within four weeks of a game .
the steelers face coventry blaze in the elite league on saturday , 4 march .
`` i know sheffield have tried to make a big media frenzy out of having to play the night before a game , '' kelman told bbc wales sport .
`` but 32 weeks of the year , pretty much , you play two games in a row and i think the fans need to understand that .
`` we had the foresight to plan not to play the night before a game , they did not and they wanted a rule put in place that you could not cancel a game in four weeks , so i do n't feel bad for them at all .
cardiff devils travel to manchester on friday to play manchester storm in the elite league , and two days later take on the steelers in the final at ice arena wales .
`` it is advantage to cardiff because they pulled that move on us that we could not move the game , '' steelers coach paul thompson said .
`` it is not fair .
it is a cup final , both teams should have the same opportunity so we are a little bit rattled about that , but i hope that comes back and haunts cardiff . ''
the devils and the steelers faced each other in the challenge cup final in 2015 and during that match it was the devils who took the victory , winning 2-1 in the sheffield arena .
kelman acknowledged that in the elite league playing back-to-back games is not uncommon , and the devils even had to play a game the night before their challenge cup final in 2015 .
`` whatever media circus they want to create over having to play the night before a game - they do it every single weekend just like nine other teams in the league do , '' kelman continued .
`` we are not worried about it and we are not rising to it .
we are just focusing on the game .
`` i do n't think the cardiff devils are the bad guys for making them obey the rule they put in place , i think it is kind of silly . ''
the devils are currently top of the elite league standings on 71 points and will be aiming for their third challenge cup trophy on sunday , after winning the cup in 2006 and 2015 .
the welsh side were runners up in the competition in 2016 after losing 1-0 against the nottingham panthers .
